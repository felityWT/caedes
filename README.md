# Caedes

This script allows you to directly encode a plaintext into DES and replace each letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet at the same time.

## Requirements

* PHP

## How to use?

* Example of how to encrypt a text;
    - `$ php caedes.php top_secret 15 c34d`

## Explanation

* The example plaintext "top_secret" that you see above is what the script is going to encrypt.
* "15" is the number of letters that you want to shift with the Caesar Cipher.
* "c34d" is the key for DES to encrypt the plaintext.
